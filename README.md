	I share my configurable experience modifier.
	You can configure the database that will store information about the players, for the blow the experience multiplier.

	You can change the total number of lines in the menu to allow the modification of the experience.
	Example: If you set 5 the player will be able to set his spleen to x5 maximum.

	All this is documented in the code, just open the script and change what needs to be changed.
